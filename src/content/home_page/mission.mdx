Our goal is to acquire a **functional understanding** of the deregulation of signalling networks in disease and to apply this knowledge to develop novel therapeutics. We focus on **cancer, auto-immune and fibrotic disease**. Towards this goal, we integrate **big ('Omics') data** with mechanistic molecular knowledge into statistical and machine learning methods, and we share our tools as **[free open-source packages](/software)**.
