# Research Areas

Our lab develops and applies computational methods to understand complex biological systems. We combine systems biology, bioinformatics, and machine learning approaches to study cellular processes and disease mechanisms.

## Systems Biology

We develop mathematical models and computational tools to understand the behavior of biological systems. Our work includes:

- Network analysis of signaling pathways
- Dynamic modeling of cellular processes
- Integration of multi-omics data
- Prediction of system behavior under different conditions

## Bioinformatics

We create and apply computational methods for analyzing biological data:

- Development of novel algorithms for data analysis
- Integration of heterogeneous biological datasets
- Visualization and interpretation of complex data
- Development of user-friendly tools for the research community

## Machine Learning in Biology

We apply machine learning techniques to solve biological problems:

- Prediction of protein-protein interactions
- Classification of disease subtypes
- Identification of biomarkers
- Analysis of high-throughput data

## Current Projects

### Project 1: Network Analysis of Signaling Pathways

We are developing new methods to analyze and predict the behavior of signaling pathways in health and disease.

### Project 2: Multi-omics Data Integration

Our lab is working on novel approaches to integrate different types of biological data to gain a more complete understanding of biological systems.

### Project 3: Machine Learning for Drug Discovery

We are applying machine learning techniques to predict drug-target interactions and identify potential therapeutic compounds.
